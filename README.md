# About
Corimbot is a Discord bot that I work on in my free time, or while procrastinating on other, more urgent tasks.
## Commands
All Corimbot commands use the "!corim" prefix.
- !corim ping - Corimbot will respond with "Pong."
- !corim thanos - Corimbot will respond with a Thanos quote randomly selected from an array.
- !corim win - Corimbot will respond with "I see this as an absolute win!"
- !corim flip (currently in-development) - Corimbot will flip a coin.
- !corim p - Corimbot will respond with a vulgar word.
- !corim snap - Corimbot will randomly sort all users in the server into two different groups.
